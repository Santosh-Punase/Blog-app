However, despite many possible underlying causes, a specific medical disorder is seldom revealed. On the other hand, mood and anxiety disorders are commonly associated with fatigue.<p>Fatigue is regarded as a nonspecific symptom as it is not typically associated with a particular disease. It is one of the most common complaints reported to medical care providers.</p>",

      "post": "Companies are starting to propose functioning exoskeletons for real applications, from soldier support to helping paraplegic patients walk. But they could also be customized to help everyday workers with their harder tasks, as Lowe's lift-easing prototype demonstrated. Ford is taking a different tack by investing in the EksoVest, a new exoskeleton that supports factory employees' upper bodies to ease strain when lifting and performing overhead tasks.<p>Certain Ford employees do these tasks up to 4,600 times per day and up to a million times per year, the automaker noted in a press release. The non-powered EksoVest, designed by Ekso Bionics in partnership with Ford, helps lift five to fifteen pounds, easing the strain on users' upper bodies and preventing some fatigue. That assistance could help prevent workplace accidents resulting from tired muscles and minds. The EksoVest fits employees from 5-feet to 6-feet 4-inches tall and is designed for anyone in load-bearing work, from factories to construction sites to distribution centers.</p>",

      "post": "Colorado state law requires municipalities to hold public referendums before they can provide services like broadband internet access. And as of Tuesday's elections, Ars Technica reports, 31 of the state's 64 counties have opted to allow their local governments to build broadband networks. Voters in Fort Collins, Colorado joined those supporting municipal broadband, approving a ballot measure giving its city council permission to establish a city-run network. The measure passed despite an anti-municipal broadband group that spent nearly half of a million dollars campaigning against it. The group was funded by the Colorado Cable Telecommunications Association and the city's chamber of commerce, which Comcast and CenturyLink are members of. And though it doesn't mean each of them will actually build their own broadband networks, over 100 cities, towns and counties in Colorado have now passed ballot measures allowing their towns to do so, Motherboard reports.",
